Hi... Welcome to my website, the Juri Pebrianto website. I'm currently enjoying learning ReactJS, Go-Lang, and other programming-related stuff.

Oh ya, from 2014 until now, I have experience in the IT and software developer fields, I focus on Backend Developers with the longest experience with the PHP (Web) programming language, as I said above, I open myself up to new technologies about programming languages, databases and everything related to programming or software development.

I have a new experience for React-Js, React-Native, Go-Lang, by the way, this website juripebrianto.my.id is made with React-Js technology as the frontend and Go-Lang as the API and CMS and uses MongoDB as the database.

I've made approximately 4 applications using Flutter/Dart plus Firebase, I also made the API, I made it using Codeigneter (PHP) with a MySql database.

PHP and MySql are a combination that I often use to create WEB applications or APIs because these two are the ones I usually use, but I've also run projects using Spring Boot (Java), Express (NodeJs), I do the work as I wish. from the client, from the design to the programming language.

The databases that I use are also quite diverse depending on the client's wishes too, so far I have made applications using MySql, MongoDB, and Redis databases.

All applications that I make usually deploy or publish at the same time, I am familiar with cPanel/WHM and also the Centos/Linux operating system that runs on a Virtual Private Server (VPS), but I still use a VPS that is generally built using Proxmox, I haven't I've used AWS, GCP and the like, due to the habit of working where the company I currently work for already has a physical server placed in the data center.

In creating applications or projects, I always use GIT, either GitHub or Gitlab as a place where I and my team can work on projects together without fear of losing files or data.

More or less the activities or whatever I do, if I have free time I usually like to travel or attend seminars/workshops/meetups related to programming or software development.

Thank you for taking the time to read this article, have a nice and healthy day.
