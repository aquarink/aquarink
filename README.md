# Hi.. how are you guys?


I am Pebri, I am currently enjoying studying Flutter. I have made several mobile apps with Flutter.

> Until now, I have had approximately 5 years of experience in Web Programming (PHP, Java, NodeJs).

> In making applications, usually a database is needed, usually I use MySql or MariaDB, I have also used MongoDb, Redis and Firestore.

> Software or tools in performing server and network needs, I use Proxmox as virtual machine management.

I am very happy to learn things that enrich my knowledge, therefore, I continued my education to Master level in 2017 at STMIK ERESHA and graduated in 2019 with a GPA of 3.41, I took Masters education because it was supported by the scholarship I got, so I didn't spend any money or expense on it.

```sh
The experiences above I got during my undergraduate studies at Pamulang University which I lived from 2012 to 2016
```
```sh
with a GPA of 3.10 and also in semester 4 while studying, I lived while working at the Jakarta Nanyang School
```
```sh
as an IT Staff from 2014 to 2016.
```
than
```sh
In 2017 I worked in a new place at PT. Muloska Pratama (Mobiwin) to date. Here I am very happy to be given
```
```sh
the opportunity to develop so that I can do a lot of exploration in terms of learning new programming languages
```
```sh
and the abilities I mentioned above.
```
I am very grateful to be able to get to where I am today, even though there will be more great people out there and in the future, I have a principle, I must also be greater.

I have a dream, I really want to have a job and work in big companies like Google, Microsoft and others, I am sure I can make that dream come true.
